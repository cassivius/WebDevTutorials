HTML5 Primer
	Tags and Elements
		<> represents a tag. 
		<>...</> represents an element. 
	Specific tags and elements
		<!DOCTYPE html> :: specifies html5 syntax
		<p> :: paragraph. Sits somewhere around (equivalent to?) h4 in size, but not bold like the h tags are
		<h1-h6> :: various levels of "heading." 1 is the largest, 6 is the smallest.

Questions: 
	What are all of the <input> types?
		type="email" - what is considered a valid email address? Anything that's ACTUALLY a valid email address? Or only naive?
