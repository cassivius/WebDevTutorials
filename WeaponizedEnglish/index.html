		<p> Welcome to the first website I've ever made. Made available in any format online, maybe. </p>
		<br> 
		<br>
		<p> Why this site, and why now? Because I'm learning actual web development, and what do web developers do but make websites? </p>
		<p> That's just me being cheeky. I am mostly interested in the backend, data transformation and storage and passing and processing. All of this front end stuff? Almost literal magic. <em>That</em> is why I'm making this website. </p>
		<p> It's my hope that by going through the necessary steps in order to build my little website, get it hosted, have it visited, have it on my resume, etc, that I will finally be able to join the ranks of those who are fully gainfully employed in the Austin area as programmers. This driving to San Antonio all the time thing isn't working! It's 93 miles to work! That's not cool! I don't want to do it any more!</p>
		<p> More important than the negative (MIIIIIILES and TIIIIIME) though are the reasons for creating this website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> To get into the habit of coding, developing, and working on my craft every day</li>
			<li> To transition into a language stack that I enjoy, and feel has good career prospects</li>
			<li> To be able to build useful tools, utilities, and just whole, complete projects. I don't want to ruin any surprises, but I hope to add a VI/VA to this website, for my own purposes at first, within a few months. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> So yeah, I want to be a better, better employed, and <em>more useful</em> developer. Who doesn't, right? </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p> And yes, I know committing to Master is a <em><strong>BAD THING</strong></em>, but it's for my own little website, and I know the flow for any more realistic project. They'll follow better practices, I promise. </p>
